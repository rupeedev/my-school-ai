# Holiday Homework Project Report

**Student Name:** [Your Name]
**Class:** 8
**Topic:** Web Development

For my holiday homework, I successfully created two distinct websites showcasing my web development skills using HTML and CSS.

The first website, titled "**My School**," highlights the infrastructure and values of my school. It features a responsive layout with a navigation bar, a "Facilities" page using a grid system, and colorful styling to represent a vibrant learning environment.

The second website, "**Artificial Intelligence**," explores the futuristic world of AI. I used a dark, neon-themed design to reflect high technology. This site includes an introduction to AI, its importance, and a gallery page demonstrating its applications in robotics and healthcare.

This project helped me practically apply concepts from our textbook, such as lists, links, external CSS, and layout management, proving that I can build functional and creative web pages.
